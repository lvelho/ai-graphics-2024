<H1> General Instructions </H1>

<HR>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>

<p> We will use Python for all assignments in
this course along with the PyTorch 3D platform.
A crash course on the Python programming language and Google Colab is the
<a href=https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/> Stanford CS231n Tutorial.</a>

<p>If you’re using Google Colab, you just need to have a google
account and an associated Google Drive.
</p>

<p>In case you’re choosing to work locally in your machine you must set Anaconda or a venv virtual environment, and install the necessary libraries.</p>

<p>Create a folder in your Google Drive or in your machine’s workspace. Copy to your drive folder or download the notebook above.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the notebook for completing the assignment.</p>

<p>You can build auxiliary .py scripts and call them from your notebook, for organizational purposes.</p>

<HR>

<h3 id="submission">Submission:</h3>

<p>Students should send their assignments before the due date to the TA with a copy to lv776@nyu.edu. Late delivers will be consider subject to a lower score.</p>

<p>The submission email should be sent with the subject “Assignment [number] - [first-name] - [last-name]”. The assignment can be structured and sent in two ways:</p>

<p>If your whole solution is implemented in the same notebook as the
one provided for the assignment, then you can send just the .ipynb
file as the solution. </p>
<p>If parts of your implementation were done in auxiliary .py scripts, then you must send both the final notebook and the scripts inside a .zip file. The organization of the code will also be considered in the evaluation.</p>
