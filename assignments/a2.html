<H1>ASSIGNMENT 2: Bundle Adjustment</H1>

<p>In this assignment, we will learn to simultaneously compute the extrinsic parameters of a set (bundle) of cameras, given multiple pairs of relative transformations between them. It’s an instance of the bundle adjustment problem, which is very important for stereoscopy and 3D reconstruction. We’ll use PyTorch3D API to set up an optimization process and minimize the discrepancies between pairs of relative cameras.</p>

<p><strong>The goals of this practice are the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Get more familiarization with camera representations</li>
  <li>Discover new APIs in PyTorch3D to work with rigid transforms</li>
  <li>Use the power of neural networks and gradient descent to solve a classic optimiation</li>
</ul>
